##

* Forked https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook into https://github.com/kalta/livebook
* git clone https://github.com/kalta/livebook nk_livebook
* git remote add upstream https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook.git

Now we have two remotes, origin and upstream. Copy the tags from upstream:
* git fetch upstream --tags    
* checkout of upstream v0.14, created branch v0.14-nk, pushed to upstream 

* mix deps.get
